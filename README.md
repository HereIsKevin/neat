## Installing

***neat*** is only functional on `bash` 4 or later, and has only been throughly tested on `bash` 5. To install, simply install with the following command.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HereIsKevin/neat/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you get `-bash: curl: command not found`, try using wget instead of curl.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HereIsKevin/neat/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you have any concerns about the shell scripts, feel free to review them on [GitHub](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/neat)
